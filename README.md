# Project Name
>Lending club is a lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. 
Therefore, the objective of this case is to identify patterns or the factors which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

## General Information
- Lending Club company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

* If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

* If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
The data given below contains information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

## Conclusions
- Debt to income(dti) ratio more than 12.5
- Grade of a applicant especially if the grade is F and C if the dti is high.
- Sub-grade of a applicant especially f5.
- Annual income less than 80k.
- House ownership as mortgage.
- Interest rate mire than 12%
- Number of bankruptcies more than 0.
